#Team 1710's Scouting Operation for 2016

##The App
Our scouting app is essentially a big form filled out by scouts based upon what they see in the matches.
At the conclusion of the match the scouts will generate a text file of raw data which is then stored in the
file system of their android phone. They then use the built in bluetooth file transfer capabilities of the
phone to send the file to a host computer where the data is processed.

##Data Proccessing
Once the data is sent to our host computer, a python script is run that imports all of the data into
an excel sheet with many helpful functions for viewing data.

##Excel sheet
The excel sheet is a very helpful resource that displays all of our data in a non-intimidating manner. It
contains a Team Search function where you type in a team number and it displays all data from recorded
matches. This comes in handy when our team had to decide what defenses to put out on the field.
